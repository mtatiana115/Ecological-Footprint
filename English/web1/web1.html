            The carbon footprint is a way to measure the impact we have on the
            planet. Every time we do something that uses energy, such as
            traveling, eating, or using our phone, we are emitting gases that
            contribute to global warming. <br /><br />
            These gases are called greenhouse gases, and they accumulate in the
            atmosphere, causing the Earth's temperature to rise. The carbon
            footprint is expressed in tons or kilos of carbon dioxide, which is
            the most abundant and harmful gas.

          How do we know if we are emitting more carbon dioxide than the planet
          can absorb?
        </h2>
        <div class="__wrapper">
          <p class="text-body--1">
            A creative and simple way to explain why the carbon footprint is
            expressed in terms of the number of planets is to imagine that each
            person has a backpack where they store all the carbon dioxide they
            emit by doing their activities. Carbon dioxide is a gas that
            contributes to global warming and is produced when using energy,
            such as electricity, transportation, or food. Every time we use
            energy, we fill our backpack with more carbon dioxide.
            <br /><br />
            Some people have bigger backpacks than others, depending on their
            lifestyle and their country. For example, the environmental NGO The
            Nature Conservancy estimates that each inhabitant of the planet
            generates an average of almost four tons of CO2 annually, while in
            countries like the United States, this amount quadruples per person
            per year.
            <br /><br />
            Now, the planet has a limited capacity to absorb the carbon dioxide
            we emit. Trees, plants, and oceans act as sponges that capture some
            of this gas and transform it into oxygen. But if we emit more carbon
            dioxide than the planet can absorb, we are saturating the atmosphere
            and causing the Earth's temperature to rise. This has serious
            consequences for the climate, biodiversity, and people's health.

        <p class="text-body--1">
          This is where the concept of the carbon footprint in planets comes in.
          The carbon footprint in planets is a way to compare our carbon dioxide
          backpack with the planet's capacity to absorb it. It is calculated by
          dividing the amount of carbon dioxide we emit by the amount of carbon
          dioxide the planet can absorb. The result tells us how many Earths we
          would need if everyone had our same carbon dioxide backpack. For
          example, if our carbon footprint in planets is 1, it means that we are
          emitting the same amount of carbon dioxide that the planet can absorb.
          But if our carbon footprint in planets is 2, it means that we are
          emitting twice as much carbon dioxide as the planet can absorb, and we
          would need two Earths to offset our emissions. And so on. <br /><br />
          The carbon footprint in planets helps us become aware of our impact on
          the environment and look for ways to reduce it. Some actions we can
          take to reduce our carbon footprint include using less energy,
          recycling, consuming local and eco-friendly products, and using
          environmentally friendly means of transportation. This way, we can
          take care of the planet and prevent climate change from becoming
          irreversible.

        <h2 class="__title text-heading--2">How is it calculated?</h2>
        <div class="__wrapper">
          <p class="text-body--1">
            To calculate the carbon footprint using utility bill information,
            you can follow a simple formula that is based on multiplying the
            consumption of each service by a corresponding emission factor. The
            emission factor is the amount of carbon dioxide generated for each
            unit of consumption.
            <br /><br />
            In this way, the results are added to the household's carbon
            footprint. This will provide a more comprehensive estimate of the
            amount of greenhouse gases emitted from the use of public services.
